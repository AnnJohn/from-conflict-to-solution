Now that you've set the stage, presented the problem, shown the "Why" of your lesson, and got your students interested, you're ready to move on to presenting material that teaches to the learning objectives you laid out earlier in your Readme.

While your Readme has a large overall arc of beginning, middle, and end, it should also have smaller arcs where you're asking new questions, raising new problems, and resolving them. Extend the original scenario you had in your beginning or present new scenarios and introduce new characters and condition. 

Don't give your students the solution/code/answers right away. It's boring, and moreover, it won't stick. Instead, walk your students step-by-step through solving things through code, show the missteps that you can take, the errors that'll occur, and also show how to fix them. 

And while really going nitty-gritty into the code is great (after all, we are teaching coding), it's important to illustrate that **scenario or situation** within which we're using our code. For example, when we cover Associations in Rails we do saw within the scenario of creating a blog and showing how blog posts relate to their authors. When we cover ORMs and ActiveRecord, we use the scenario of a music player that connects artists, songs, albums, and genres. When we talk about Object Orientation in Ruby, we use the scenario of students and classes. These real-world, simple examples ground what can otherwise be abstract concepts into something very tangible. 

Use **metaphors** wherever possible to connect new ideas to known concepts. 

Here’s an example of metaphors that were used when explaining methods to students:

**Metaphor** Methods are like Vending Machines. You put some sort of input in, and some magic happens, then output happens.

**Metaphor** Methods can do a bit more because they don't always need input. When your mom says to get dressed, you then break that down into underwear, pants, shirt, socks, shoes. Now she doesn't need to repeat herself

*Tip*: To show that moments of tension are happening in your lesson, use shorter words and sentences, especially as it rises to the climax where the solution(s) is/are presented. 

## How Do I Break Up All of That Narrative So That I Don’t End Up with One Long Essay? 

Short answer; trust your instincts. At a minimum, your beginning, middle, and end should be its own sections. Don’t title it “Beginning,” “Middle,” and “End” because that’s pretty boring. Instead use short, descriptive titles that’ll motivate students to read. 

As a rule of thumb, each of your learning objectives should have its own paragraph (or sometimes multiple) devoted to it. 

Another great way to break up the monotony of text is through code blocks. Always use code examples wherever possible and weave them in with your larger narrative. When including code snippets, a student should be able to copy and paste it as is in a repl or a file and execute it with the intended result stated in the Readme. 

Explain all the parts of the code a student isn’t already familiar with and if you can, build on and manipulate your code blocks and snippets as you continue through the lesson. Let’s continue with our vending metaphor and methods examples. 

In addition to code snippets, make your content visual. Add diagrams and charts to help organize material and make concepts more clear.

## What About Voice and Tone? Is there a Flatiron School or Learn Style I Need to Follow?

Our voice when writing curriculum is a reflection of our core values. We are ambitious, optimistic, scrappy, community-oriented, and nerdy in the best kind of way. 

Don’t be afraid to be passionate and confident. Don’t shy away from being smart but always remember to be thoughtful.

Be friendly and accessible. Be informal and feel free to address your audience in the second person. Be silly! Use gifs, make jokes, and be cheeky at times. Avoid first person singular (“I”) and always use the first-person plural (“We”).  Be reassuring.
